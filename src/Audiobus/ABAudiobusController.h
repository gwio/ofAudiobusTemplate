#pragma mark State IO Protocol
/** @name State IO Protocol */
///@{
  
/*!
 * State input/output delegate protocol
 *
 *  This protocol is used to provide app-specific state data when a preset
 *  is saved within Audiobus. This state data will then be presented back to
 *  your app when the user loads the saved preset within Audiobus, so your 
 *  app can restore the prior state.
 *
 *  The nature of the state information to be saved and restored is up to you.
 *  It should be enough to put your app into the same operating state as when
 *  the preset was saved, but should not necessarily contain the user's content.
 *  Presets should represent workspaces, rather than complete projects.
 *
 *  To assist in streamlining your app initialization, when your app is being
 *  launched from a preset within Audiobus, Audiobus will launch your app by
 *  providing the string "incoming-preset" to the host part of the app launch
 *  URL. For example, if your Audiobus launch URL is "myapp.audiobus://", launching
 *  your app from within an Audiobus preset will cause the app to be launched
 *  with the URL "myapp.audiobus://incoming-preset". You can then detect this
 *  condition from within `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:`
 */

 * Provide a dictionary to represent the current app state
 *
 *  This dictionary can represent any state you deem relevant to the saved

 *  @link loadStateFromAudiobusStateDictionary:responseMessage: @endlink.
 *  It may only contain values that can be represented in a Property List
 *  (See Apple's "Property List Types and Objects" documentation).
 *
 *  You may include NSData objects representing larger resources, if
 *  appropriate, such as audio data for a sampler. To avoid loading large
 *  files into memory all at once, you can request that the NSData use
 *  memory-mapping via the NSDataReadingMappedIfSafe hint.
 *
 *  Note: You should not spend more than a couple hundred milliseconds
 *  (at most) gathering state information in this method.
